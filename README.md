# OpenRA Clean
OpenRA is a fun game, but it is a little violent for my likings, and I
would not be suprised if someone else out there agrees.
OpenRA Clean (this project) is my attempt at removing the blood,
screaming, and other things in OpenRA that just shouldn't be there.

# Installation
At the moment the only install method is from source, for instruction on
that visit INSTALL.md. A snapcraft package is planned and I hope for
other ways to become available soon. I don't know too much about windows
or macos compiling (I run linux exclusively) and so I don't have the
ability to compile for those operating systems. If you would like to, and
please do, help me out by compiling it for these OSs and sharing the
compiled version with me.

# Contributing
The code of OpenRA-clean is almost the exact same as normal OpenRA, the
awesome developers at OpenRA created an great mod system and the only
changes that are needed to be made to remove the violence is simply
changing the contents of the mods folder. If you would like to change the
actual C# code, then you should go to the upstream repository. If you
found some violence we forgot then submit an issue, or better yet, make a
pull request. I have not removed the code of conduct, or other
contributor MD files because I want to change as little as possible,
these files contain information that is to be discarded.
