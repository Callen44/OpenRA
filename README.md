# OpenRA Clean
OpenRA is a fun game, but it is a little violent for my likings, and I would not be suprised if someone else out there agrees.
OpenRA Clean (this repository) is my attempt at removing the blood, screming, and other things in OpenRA that just shouldn't be there.
I mean seriously, we all recognize the terribleness of WW2, but why do we fail to take seriously the death, pain, and suffering that took place there?

# Installation
The installation of this repository is the exact same as normal OpenRA, I'm working on adding other ways, but at the moment the only install method is from source, for instruction on that visit INSTALL.md.

# Contributing
The code of OpenRA-clean is the exact same as the source repository, the awesome developers at OpenRA created an amazing mod system and the only changes that are needed to be made to remove the violence is simply changing the contents of the mods folder. If you have something that you would like to be done better in a folder other than mods folder, submit your code to https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA and then we will hopefully sync the changes from their repo to ours.
