# OpenRA Clean Contribution Guidelines.

OpenRA Clean is not intended to be an especially flashy fork, the only reason it exists is the remove the violence from OpenRA, therefore I hope you understand that there are certain types of Contributions that may be denied in some cases.

### Contributions that may or may not be accepted
* New features
* Bug fixes (yes I know) that also exist on the source repository
* Contributions relating to anything other than the removal of violence

### Contributions allowed
* removing violence
* removing bugs that exist only on this repository and not on the OpenRA/OpenRA repo
* compiling for other operating systems

Don't let this file spook you! if you have something that you would like to change then contribute to the source repository at https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA.
